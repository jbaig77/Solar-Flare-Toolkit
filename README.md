# Solar-Flare-Toolkit
This is a toolkit which currently detects and counts the number of solar flares that are in a given month, provided a csv file that obtains the data from the GOES 13 satellite. Future potential tasks are to classify each solar flare, and possibly output what region of the sun the solar flare took place.
